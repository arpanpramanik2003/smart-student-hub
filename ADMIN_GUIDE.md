## 🎯 Secure Admin Setup

### 🔐 No Default Admin Created

For **maximum security**, this system does **NOT** auto-create a default admin user with hardcoded credentials.

Instead, you must **manually create** the admin account using a secure confirmation code.

### How to Create Admin Account

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/admin-password-reset`

**Method:** Use PowerShell/Terminal with a secret confirmation code

**Required Environment Variable on Render:**
```env
ADMIN_RESET_CODE=your-secret-confirmation-code-here
```

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. Add Environment Variable to Render
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your service
2. Click **Environment** tab
3. Add new variable:
   - **Key:** `ADMIN_RESET_CODE`
   - **Value:** `<your-secure-random-string>` (create a strong random code)
4. Click **Save Changes** (will auto-redeploy)

#### 2. Create Admin via PowerShell
Once deployed, run this command in PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://smart-student-hub-sj5o.onrender.com/api/auth/admin-password-reset" -Method POST -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} -Body '{"confirmCode":"YOUR_ADMIN_RESET_CODE","newUsername":"admin@yourdomain.com","newPassword":"YourSecurePassword123!"}'
```

**Parameters:**
- `confirmCode`: Must match `ADMIN_RESET_CODE` from Render (replace YOUR_ADMIN_RESET_CODE)
- `newUsername`: Your admin email
- `newPassword`: Strong password (min 8 characters)

#### 3. Success Response
```json
{
  "message": "Admin user created successfully",
  "username": "admin@yourdomain.com"
}
```

### Security Features:
✅ No hardcoded admin credentials in code  
✅ Confirmation code stored only in environment variables  
✅ Failed attempts are logged  
✅ Password must be at least 8 characters  
✅ Can reset admin password anytime using same endpoint  
✅ Works even if admin already exists (updates credentials)

## 🔄 How to Reset Admin Credentials

### Method 1: Using Secure Reset Endpoint (Recommended) ⭐
Run this PowerShell command:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://smart-student-hub-sj5o.onrender.com/api/auth/admin-password-reset" -Method POST -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} -Body '{"confirmCode":"YOUR_ADMIN_RESET_CODE","newUsername":"newemail@domain.com","newPassword":"NewSecurePassword123!"}'
```

**What it does:**
- Updates existing admin username and password
- Creates new admin if none exists
- Validates confirmation code against `ADMIN_RESET_CODE` env variable
- Logs all attempts for security monitoring

**Requirements:**
- Confirmation code must match `ADMIN_RESET_CODE` in Render
- Password must be at least 8 characters

### Method 2: Through Application
1. Login as admin: https://smart-student-hub-inky.vercel.app
2. Go to **Profile** or **Settings**
3. Click **Change Password**
4. Enter new password
5. Save changes

### Method 3: Directly in Supabase Database (Emergency Only)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **smart-student-hub**
3. Click **Table Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Find table: `users`
5. Locate admin user (role: 'admin')
6. Click **Edit** on the row
7. Update fields:
   - `email`: Change to your preferred email
   - `name`: Change to your name
   - ⚠️ `password`: **DON'T** edit directly (it's hashed)
8. Save changes
9. Use Method 1 to reset password properly

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
1. **Change default admin credentials immediately**
2. **Use strong passwords** (min 12 characters, mix of upper/lower/numbers/symbols)
3. **Enable 2FA** (if implemented)
4. **Regularly update dependencies**: `npm audit fix`
5. **Monitor Render logs** for suspicious activity
6. **Use environment variables** for all secrets
7. **Keep `.env` files secure** and never commit them
8. **Regular database backups** (Supabase has automatic backups)
9. **Limit admin access** - create separate faculty accounts
10. **Review user permissions** regularly

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Never share admin credentials**
2. **Don't use `admin123` in production**
3. **Don't commit `.env` files** to Git
4. **Don't expose sensitive data** in logs
5. **Don't give everyone admin access**
6. **Don't skip security updates**
7. **Don't use HTTP** (always use HTTPS)
8. **Don't store passwords in plain text**

## 🗑️ Files to Remove Before Production

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Remove These Files:

#### 1. Local Environment Files
```bash
backend/.env
backend/.env.local
backend/.env.development
```
**Reason:** Contains sensitive credentials (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, Google Drive credentials)

**Action:** These are already in `.gitignore`, but verify they're NOT in your Git repository:
```bash
git ls-files | grep .env
```
If found, remove them:
```bash
git rm --cached backend/.env
git commit -m "Remove .env file from repository"
git push
```

#### 2. Local Database Files
```bash
backend/smart_student_hub.db
backend/smart_student_hub.db-shm
backend/smart_student_hub.db-wal
```
**Reason:** Local SQLite database (used in development only)

**Action:** Delete manually or ensure `.gitignore` blocks them

#### 3. Test/Debug Files
```bash
backend/test.js
backend/debug.log
backend/scripts/createAdmin.js (if exists)
```
**Reason:** May contain hardcoded credentials or debug info

#### 4. Uploaded Files (if committed)
```bash
backend/uploads/*
```
**Reason:** User uploads should be in Google Drive, not Git

**Action:** Add to `.gitignore`:
```
uploads/
!uploads/.gitkeep
```

#### 5. Node Modules (if accidentally committed)
```bash
node_modules/
```
**Reason:** Huge size, security vulnerabilities

**Action:** Should already be in `.gitignore`, but verify

#### 6. IDE/Editor Files
```bash
.vscode/settings.json (if contains secrets)
.idea/
*.swp
.DS_Store
```
**Reason:** May contain local paths or settings

## 🔒 Environment Variables Security

### Required Environment Variables (Render)

These are stored **ONLY** on Render (not in code):

```env
# Server Config
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000

# Security
JWT_SECRET=<64-character-random-string>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
ADMIN_RESET_CODE=<your-secret-confirmation-code>

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.mjqnougcxzyobauhgkse:Smart@123@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

# CORS
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://smart-student-hub-inky.vercel.app

# Cloudinary (File Storage)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloud-name-from-dashboard>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-api-key-from-dashboard>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<click-to-reveal-in-dashboard>
```

**New Variable:** `ADMIN_RESET_CODE`
- **Purpose:** Secret code required to create/reset admin account
- **Example:** Use a secure random string (generate with: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`)
- **Usage:** Used with `/api/auth/admin-password-reset` endpoint
- **Security:** Keep this secret! Anyone with this code can reset admin credentials

### How to Rotate Secrets:

#### 1. JWT Secret
```bash
# Generate new secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"

# Update in Render:
# Settings → Environment → Edit JWT_SECRET → Save → Redeploy
```

#### 2. Database Password
```
1. Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database
2. Click "Reset database password"
3. Update DATABASE_URL in Render
4. Redeploy backend
```

#### 3. Cloudinary Credentials
```
1. Cloudinary Dashboard → Settings → Access Keys
2. Click "Generate New API Secret" (if needed)
3. Update CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET in Render
4. Redeploy backend
5. Test file upload functionality
```
